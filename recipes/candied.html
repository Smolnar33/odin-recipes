    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This candied yams recipe is a simple and quick way to enjoy a
      Thanksgiving favorite! Canned yams or sweet potatoes may be
      used.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallow</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain the syrup: This is a key move so your candied yams don't
        turn out runny due to too much liquid in the baking dish.
        Place the drained yams into a medium baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dice the butter: Cut the cold butter into small pieces and
        distribute them evenly over the yams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the brown sugar: Measure the brown sugar by packing
        it firmly into the measuring cup. Then transfer it to a bowl
        to break it up and make it easier to sprinkle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with mini marshmallows: This is where you might use more
        than the amount of marshmallows called for in the recipe,
        depending on how much surface area you're covering
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Because the yams are fully cooked already, what you're
        really doing is heating them up and toasting the marshmallows
        until they're golden and melty
      </li>
    </ol>
